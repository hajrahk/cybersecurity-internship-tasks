# Keylogger

This project is a simple keylogger written in Python. It records keystrokes on the system and saves them to a text file.

## Features
- Logs all keystrokes to `keylog.txt`
- Exits cleanly when the ESC key is pressed

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation
Install the required Python package:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## Usage
1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```
2. **Stop the keylogger:**
   - Press the `ESC` key to exit and stop logging.

## Notes
- The log file `keylog.txt` will be created in the same directory as the script.
- For more details, see the `Keylogger Report.docx`.
